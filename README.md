Introduction

Binary-to-Gray Code Conversion

Binary-to-Gray code conversion is a fundamental operation in digital systems that transforms binary numbers into their corresponding Gray code representation. Gray code is widely used in applications requiring smooth transitions since only one bit changes between consecutive numbers.

Key Benefits:

Glitch-free operation

Error detection

Simplified hardware implementation

This report covers the algorithm, Verilog implementation, hardware components, and real-world applications of binary-to-Gray code conversion.

Applications:

Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs): Reduces glitches and improves accuracy.

Rotary Encoders: Provides a smooth and glitch-free output.

Digital Control Systems: Ensures accurate and reliable control signals.

Data Transmission: Minimizes errors and improves data integrity.

Implementation

Code:

This section includes the Verilog code for Binary-to-Gray code conversion.

module binary_to_gray (
    input [3:0] binary,
    output [3:0] gray
);
    assign gray[3] = binary[3];
    assign gray[2] = binary[3] ^ binary[2];
    assign gray[1] = binary[2] ^ binary[1];
    assign gray[0] = binary[1] ^ binary[0];
endmodule
